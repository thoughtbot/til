# Sass and Compass Color Functions

There are a lot of handy functions for manipulating base colors using Sass
outside of the basic `darken` and `lighten`.

### Interesting examples:

Mix - mixes two colors together: 

`mix($color-1, $color-2, [$weight])`

Red - grab only the red component of another color:

`red($color)`
(can also use this for blue and green)

Complement - outputs a complementary color

`complement($color)`

Invert - outputs an inverse color 

`invert($color)`
