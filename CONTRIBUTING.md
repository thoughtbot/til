## Writing a good a TIL

TIL's should be a focused and concise piece of knowledge that's interesting and
worth sharing with others.

Here's some guidelines on how to write a great TIL:

* Avoid writing more than 60 lines of content.
* Avoid writing more than 2 examples.
* Avoid going into too much detail.
* Avoid writing TIL's that explicitly violate [our guides].

If you find TIL straying from these guidelines consider narrowing the scope of
your TIL or writing a blog post on the subject.
