### node versions

It's really important to use *right* node version.
Use https://github.com/creationix/nvm or https://github.com/tj/n

### nvm
Install node version
```
nvm install 0.10.32
nvm use 0.10.32
```
Set as default (sometimes nvm is «forgetting» version if aliases aren't set)
```
nvm alias default v0.10.32
nvm alias system v0.10.32
```

### n

See https://github.com/tj/n — there's even a gif there.
